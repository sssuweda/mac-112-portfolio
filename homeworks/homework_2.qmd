# Exercise 0

## Part a

We'll be using some data stored in the `mosaic` and `fivethirtyeight` packages. Follow the instructions from Activity 3 to:

-   Check whether you already have these packages.
-   If not, install them.

## Part b

```{r}
# Load packages we'll need for HW 2: tidyverse, mosaic, fivethirtyeight

library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(fivethirtyeight)
```

\
\
\
\

# Exercise 1

The `Birthdays` dataset in the `mosaic` package includes information on births in the United States. Run the chunk below which *wrangles* this information into a new dataset, `daily_births`, which records the total number of `births` per day in the U.S. between 1969 and 1988.

::: {.callout-important title="Instructions"}
Use `daily_births`, not `Birthdays` in the exercises.
:::

```{r}
# Create the daily_births dataset
# Don't worry about the code. We'll learn this in the next unit!
data("Birthdays")
daily_births <- Birthdays %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(births = sum(births)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date), 
         month = month(date, label = TRUE),
         day_of_month = mday(date),
         day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE))
```

## Part a

Let's get to know the data! Complete the tasks indicated by each comment in the chunk below. Put your code directly after the relevant comment.

```{r}
# Determine the number of data points we have
dim("Birthdays")

# Check out the first 6 rows of the dataset
head("Birthdays")

# Check out the structure / class of each variable in the dataset (1 line of code)

data.frame("Birthdays")
str(Birthdays)

```

\
\

## Part b

Notice from your work in part a that `day_of_week` and `month` are special types of *categorical* variables: `Ord.factors` or **ordinal factors**. Explain what makes `day_of_week` and `month` *ordinal*.

::: {.callout-important title="Instructions"}
Looking up a definition of "ordinal" is fair, but you need to interpret the definition in the context of the variables here.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}
Days of the week and month are ordinal because they are technically numbers but exist within the same scale such as 1-31 for days of the week, and 1-12 for months of the year.
:::

\
\

## Part c

What are the units of observation?

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}
The units of observation are state, year, month, day, date, weekday, and number of births
:::

\
\
\
\

# Exercise 2

Our general goal is to understand how births vary from day to day. Let's start by focusing on just the `births` variable.

## Part a

Construct *two* plots of `births`. Each plot should use a different layer / geometric element.

```{r}
# Plot 1
ggplot (daily_births, aes(x=births)) + geom_histogram()

```

```{r}
# Plot 2

ggplot(daily_births, aes(x=births)) + geom_density()

```

## Part b

Summarize your observations about daily births in the U.S. Tell a *cohesive* story here (not a list of distinct observations) that incorporates important aspects of quantitative variables: range, distribution / shape, typical outcome, outliers.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}
On most days there are 8,000-1,110 births, it is uncommon for more than 1,200 births to occur in a single day.
:::

\
\
\
\

# Exercise 3

Your plots above illustrate that there's something interesting happening here! Perhaps it can be explained by changes in birth rates over *time*. For example, we might wonder: Have births increased or decreased? Have there been any peaks or valleys in births? Are there any seasonal trends?

## Part a

Construct a plot of births over time. Only use 2 variables in your plot and make sure that every data point is represented in the plot (not just a summary of trends). We'll come back to this later.

```{r}

ggplot(data=daily_births, aes(x=year, y=births)) + geom_point() 



```

```{r}
ggplot(data = daily_births, aes(x=year, y=births, color = month)) + geom_point() 


```

## Part b

Summarize your observation about births over time. Be sure to comment on the following:

-   What are the longer-term birth trends over time (on the scale of years)?
-   Are there any seasonal trends within years (on the scale of months)?
-   What other interesting or unusual patterns do you notice?!?

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}
The births begins to decrease at 1970 and then gradually increase past 1975.
:::

\
\
\
\

# Exercise 4

Your above plot of births over time has an interesting pattern: there seem to be 2-3 distinct groups of points. Let's sleuth it out.

## Part a

Starting from your plot of births over time from above, add a new scale / variable that explains the distinction between the distinct groups.

::: {.callout-important title="Instructions"}
Use your intuition--What variables do we have that might explain the 2 groups? and play around. If you get stuck, move on to Exercise 5 and come back.
:::

```{r}

ggplot(data=daily_births, aes(x=year, y=births, fill=day_of_week)) + geom_point() 


```

## Part b

Explain in words *what* is going on here (e.g. "over time, there tend to be more births on... than on....") and *why* you think this is happening. NOTE: The "why" might be challenging, so just do your best.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}
The increase in birth rates past 1975 could be due to political/socio-economic concerns like the war in Vietnam. In the year 1975 many U.S soldier returned and following 1975 the birth rate gradually increases.
:::

\
\
\
\

# Exercise 5

Let's dig into weekly and monthly birth trends.

## Part a

Construct 2 plots that illustrate how birth rates might vary by month, one using density plots and another using boxplots. One of these will be more useful than the other!

```{r}
ggplot(data=daily_births, aes(x=births, color=month)) + geom_density()

```

## Part b

Construct a plot that illustrates how birth rates might vary by day of the week.

```{r}
ggplot(data=daily_births, aes(x=year, y=births)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~ month)
```

## Part c

Summarize your observations from parts a and b. Do birth rates tend to be higher in some months than others? Or higher on some days of the weeks than others? Explain.

::: {.callout-important title="Instructions"}
If you skipped Exercise 4, you now have the hints.

# Exercise 6

In the remaining exercises, we'll explore new data. The "Bechdel test" tests whether movies meet the following criteria:

-   there are at least 2 characters that identify as women
-   these characters talk to each other
-   at least 1 time, they talk about something other than men

In the fivethirtyeight.com article ["The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood's Exclusion of Women"](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/), the authors analyze which Hollywood movies do/don't pass the test. Their data are available in the `fivethirtyeight` package\
Run the chunk below which *wrangles* this information into a new dataset, `new_bechdel`, which tidies up some of the categorical variables.

```{r}
# Create the new_bechdel dataset
# Don't worry about the code. We'll learn this in the next unit!
data(bechdel)
new_bechdel <- bechdel %>%
  mutate(clean_test = factor(clean_test, c("nowomen", "notalk", "men", "dubious", "ok"))) %>%
  mutate(half_decades = cut(year, breaks = seq(1969, 2014, by = 5)))
```

::: {.callout-important title="Instructions"}
-   Use `new_bechdel`, not `bechdel` in the exercises.
-   Before using the `new_bechdel` data, check out the codebook by typing `?bechdel` in the **CONSOLE**.
:::

## Part a

Construct a plot that addresses the following research question: Do bigger budgets (`budget_2013`) pay off with greater box office returns (`domgross_2013`)? In constructing this plot:

-   Include a layer that represents each individual film in the dataset. There are a lot of data points, so use transparency to improve the visualization.
-   Include a layer that highlights the *trends* in this relationship.
-   Pay attention to which of these is the *response* variable and which is the *predictor*.

```{r}
bechdel %>% summarize(median(budget_2013))
bechdel %>% ggplot(aes (x=budget_2013, y=domgross_2013)) +geom_point()
```

## Part b

Create new plot, which tweaks the plot in part a, that addresses the following research question: Does the dependence of box office returns on budget differ among films that do and do not pass the Bechdel test? In examining the Bechdel test, use a variable that simply captures PASS or FAIL for each film.

```{r}
bechdel  %>% count(binary)

bechdel %>% ggplot(aes (x=budget_2013, y=domgross_2013, color=binary)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Part c

Summarize your observations about the relationship between box office returns and budget, and how (if at all) this differs between films that do and do not pass the Bechdel test.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}
Movies that fail the bechdel test can still have a high gross rate, out of the highest grossing films few pass the bechdel test.
:::

\
\
\
\

# Exercise 7

The `clean_test` variable goes into more detail than the `binary` variable. Not only does it indicate whether a film passes the test, it indicates *why* a failing film fails. Read more about it in the codebook.

## Part a

Construct a plot of the `clean_test` variable that allows us to explore the number of films that fall into each category.

```{r}
bechdel  %>% count(clean_test)
bechdel %>% ggplot(aes (x=clean_test)) +geom_bar()
```

## Part b

Among films that fail the Bechdel test, what's the primary reason?

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}
Out of the films that fail the bechdel test, the majority of them fall into the "no talk" category, this means that there were fewer than two\
women in the film.
:::

\

## Part c

Consider two more questions: How are the films in the data set distributed across half decades, i.e. 5-year periods (`half_decades`)? And within each `half_decade`, how are the films distributed across Bechdel categories (`clean_test`)? Construct a single plot that answers both of these questions. Your y-axis should reflect *counts*, i.e. numbers of movies.

```{r}
new_bechdel %>% ggplot(aes (x=half_decades, fill=clean_test))+ geom_bar()
```

\
\
\
\

# Exercise 8

NOTE: The following exercise is inspired by a similar exercise by Albert Kim, a `fivethirtyeight` package co-author.

The plot in Exercise 7 illustrates that more of the films in our dataset are more recent, but it's not easy to examine the breakdown of the Bechdel test in each 5-year period. To that end, return to the fivethirtyeight.com article (linked above and in the codebook) and examine the plot titled "The Bechdel Test Over Time".

## Part a

Summarize the trends captured by this plot. (How has the representation of women in movies evolved over time?)

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}
As the values on the X-axis increase, the category of "ok" gross, this mean as time goes on more movies begin to pass the bechdel test.
:::

\
\

## Part b

Recreate this plot from the article! Your plot won't look *exactly* like the authors', but should be close to that below. You'll need to add the following layer to get a similar color scheme:

```{r eval=FALSE}
scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "salmon", "pink", "steelblue1", "steelblue4"))
```

```{r, out.width = "800px",echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Proportional barplot of Bechdel test results across 5 year time periods. An increasing number of movies pass the Bechdel test over time but still only make up about 50% of the movies in the most recent time period.'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/bechdel_hist.png")
```

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5.5}

```
